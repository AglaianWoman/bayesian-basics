## Texts

Unless otherwise noted, these can be a bit more intermediate or advanced depending on how statistical/data analysis is taught within one's discipline. I've noted the more introductory or applied texts.

Gelman, A., Carlin, J. B., Stern, H. S., Dunson, D. B., Vehtari, A., and Rubin, D. B. (2013). *Bayesian Data Analysis*.

Gill, J. (2015). *Bayesian methods : a social and behavioral sciences approach*.

Jackman, S. (2009). *Bayesian analysis for the social sciences*.

Kruschke, J. (2014) *Doing Bayesian Data Analysis*. Very intro book, but might be good for those not too confident in statistics generally speaking. And who doesn't like puppies? Second edition has Stan examples. (intro)

Lunn, D., Jackson, C., Best, N., Thomas, A., and Spiegelhalter, D. (2012). *The BUGS Book: A Practical Introduction to Bayesian Analysis*. Very applied with easily digestible examples.

Lynch, S. M. (2007). *Introduction to applied Bayesian statistics and estimation for social scientists*.

McElreath, R. (2015). *Statistical Rethinking*.  A good modeling book in general, by one who has contributed a lot to helping others learn Stan.  Comes with its own R package too. (intro to moderate)
