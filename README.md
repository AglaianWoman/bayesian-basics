# bayesian-basics

Raw files for a document that introduces Bayesian data analysis. While the focus is on concepts, demonstration is primarily via Stan, though BUGS, JAGS, and some raw R code is also available for those interested. It is currently undergoing a format change and content update.  [link to doc](https://m-clark.github.io/docs/IntroBayes.html)
